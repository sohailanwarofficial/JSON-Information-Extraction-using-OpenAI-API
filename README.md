This Python code snippet demonstrates how to use the OpenAI API to extract specific information from a JSON input based on a predefined prompt. The code prompts the user to input a JSON string and then sends a request to the OpenAI API to extract the specified information, including Software, Type, Threat, and Details.

**Usage:**

1. Set up your OpenAI API key:
   - Replace `"sk-xyz"` with your actual OpenAI API key in the `api_key` variable.

2. Run the code:
   - Execute the Python code, and it will prompt you to enter a JSON string.

3. JSON Prompt:
   - Enter a JSON string that contains the data from which you want to extract information. The code will use a predefined prompt to instruct the model on what to extract.

4. Extraction:
   - The code sends a request to the OpenAI API, and the extracted information will be printed to the console.

**Requirements:**
- Python 3.x
- `requests` library (You can install it using `pip install requests`)

**Example:**

```
Enter the JSON prompt: {"Software": "Example Software", "Type": "Utility", "Threat": "Low", "Details": "This is an example software with low threat level."}

Extracted Information:
Software: Example Software
Type: Utility
Threat: Low
Details: This is an example software with low threat level.
```

**Note:**
Ensure that you have an OpenAI API key, and you may need to customize the prompt or modify the code to suit your specific JSON structure or extraction requirements.
